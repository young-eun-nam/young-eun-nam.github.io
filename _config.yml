  Hello, I am Youngeun Nam. I am a Ph.D. student in [Data Mining Lab](https://www.kaistdmlab.org/) at KAIST.
  <mark>Data mining</mark> is a process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems.
  Recently, I am studying outlier detection using deep learning in time-series data.
  Furthermore, I am particularly interested in the sports domain, and I have worked as a data analyst at a sports data analysis company, named Fitogeter.
